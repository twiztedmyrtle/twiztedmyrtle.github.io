It was impossible to resist <a href="http://www.flyinghanuman.com/" target="_blank">The Flying Hanuman</a>, a thrilling zip lining eco adventure in Phuket, Thailand.

Our party of 8 got suited up. The stench of hundreds of people's body odor was living and breathing within the gear. I was thankful to know that my gag reflexes were in good working order ![:)](/img/twiztedmyrtle/simple-smile.png) . And like a dummy, I innocently and confidently asked one of the guides if they had febreze. My sister was in stitches and disbelief while I made this request. The guide responded without missing a beat ...
 he showed me his armpits, ushering me to smell them in lieu of febreze ![:)](/img/twiztedmyrtle/simple-smile.png) . Good one. He got me!

Once we got started on the zip lines, I honestly could not smell anything. It was like the stench just went away for a long hike. Everything was a moot point moving forward. We were one with nature and adrenaline. It doesn't get any better than this. We had signed up for their "Journey B" which consisted of 28 platforms – 15 awesome ziplines, 2 fun sky bridges, 2 cool abseil points, 3 insane spiral stairways and 1 sky rail. The longest flight was 400m of pure exhilarating fun while soaking in the spectacular views of the beautiful lush rainforest from an incredible vantage point. It was a bite of heaven.

One of our friends signed up for this thrilling adventure despite his very real and severe fear of heights. He was committed and there was no going back. He was shaky on the first couple of zip lines. And then something really cool happened. He absolutely LOVED the experience. He genuinely started to enjoy the experience and was having the time of his life. That was incredibly brave of him to try something that he was genuinely fearful of and overcome it. The surprising part was that he ended the evening by sharing that this was his top experiences of all time in his life to date!

The Flying Hanuman was an incredible day to remember. No doubt about it. It was thrilling, adventurous, captivating, fun, serene and peaceful ...
 all at the same time. The guides truly make this a top-notch experience with their down to earth, easy going, terrific sense of humor and pranks. I know that when I return to Phuket, I will be going back to experience the [John Gray Sea Canoe](/posts/magical-islands-phuket.html) tour and The Flying Hanuman again; only this time, smarter and with a bottle of febreze ![:)](/img/twiztedmyrtle/simple-smile.png) . They are top 2 must do activities in Phuket.
