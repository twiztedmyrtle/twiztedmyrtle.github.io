The beauty of traveling is when you run into the unexpected and new learnings await you. I had such an encounter during my recent travels to Portland, Oregon. I was drawn by an intriguing costume parade taking place in the lobby of the DoubleTree hotel where I was staying. So I followed the costumes. I discovered there was a convention taking place – GearCon 2014. Little did I know, I was about to time travel to an entirely different world!

Each attendee was flaunting an incredibly unique and creative costume. It was hard to focus on any one of them because you wanted to consume the visual spectacle in its entirety and detail without missing a beat. This reminded me of the movies Wild Wild West and Sherlock Holmes. But I knew there was more to them than costumes and my minuscule frame of reference through Hollywood. So I proclaimed my ignorance and started asking questions. The conversations I had with folks at the convention were inspiring and fascinating.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk" target="_blank">Steampunk</a> is a subculture and a creative movement in retro futurism. It is embedded in the British Victorian Era or American Wild West and revisits that time period from the perspective of science fiction and future, with the concept that steam power has regained mainstream use. Steam comes from the social and technological aspects of the 19th century, and punk derives from their rebellion against certain aspects of that century.

 "Steampunk was first a phenomenon in speculative literature [such as H.G. Wells and Jules Verne], and the goal of those writers was to revisit the Victorian/Gilded Age setting of nascent science fiction with the vision & artistic maturity that had been lavished on the spacefaring future by their contemporaries and predecessors, all colored by a sense of if-they'd-known-then-what-we-know-now. Since then (arguably the mid-1970s), steampunk has expanded to include arts & crafts, fashion/costuming, performing arts, visual & industrial design, and even engineering and architecture. It's a multidisciplinary exercise in retrofuturism," says Stephen Couchman, Independent Film Festival and Convention Producer. Couchman is the Director of <a href="http://www.steampunkfilmfestival.com/" target="_blank">Steampunk Film Festival</a> and Producer of <a href="http://www.pdxgearcon.com" target="_blank">GearCon</a>.

The fans that are involved with Steampunk are varied. They range in age from young children to students in high school to parents to retirees. For many, this is a family affair. It has something for everyone. They also come from diverse backgrounds like artists, writers, historians, psychology, software and mechanical engineers, teachers, cashiers and so on.

Fans incorporate Steampunk into their lives from barely to hobby to a way of life. Steampunk gadgets and designs are manifested in their clothing, watches, phones, furniture, cars and their homes. "For most, a cherished hobby and social rally point. For the creators, their work is life consuming ...
 some are wholly-invested on the eat-breathe-dream level, and I'd speculate that most people in my position (event producers, editors, curators, podcasters, etc) share that extreme. There's another level of engagement with steampunk, which is "barely." Some people never dig deeper than the aesthetic; their steampunk is a costume party theme or a graphical style for wedding invitations. And that's fine too," shared Couchman.

I was blown away by the detail and meticulous work that many had poured into their handmade costumes that took months, if not years, to craft. Their creativity meshed with technological genius of their gadgets was mind blowing and pure fun. I loved how they were artistically and intelligently able to express themselves and their passion for Steampunk. They encourage everyone to be themselves. Despite my lack of any Steampunk gear and clearly being an "outsider," the attendees and vendors were all very friendly and welcoming. Some were socially awkward, but still, approachable and engaging. No one saw me as an outsider. Instead, they took the time to educate me without being condescending, rude or any number of other unpleasant reactions that someone could potentially have. They were inclusive, warm and non-judgmental – perhaps more of what our world needs today the most.

### More from my interview with Stephen Couchman –

### What was the hook for you? What was it that truly excited you about Steampunk?

Couchman – I first got into Steampunk in the 1990s through reading novels by William Gibson for example. The rest wasn't really up to me. In 2010, while mounting the inaugural Steampunk Film Festival (theme for a proof of concept film festival), I was flooded with requests for people to attend, perform, present, sell merchandise and so on. Most of this festival's ramp-up time consisted of telling very talented people, "I'm sorry, we're full." We did not have enough space or time allotted during this festival for the demand. I perceived that these creators and their supporting community deserved not only a decent public outing, but a rich ensemble presentation. I thought it would be fun and rewarding to curate such an event. Also, since I had rapidly become (arguably) the best-positioned, best-connected person in Portland to mount a steampunk convention, I felt I had a duty to manifest it. Then we did so, and I got addicted to the rush of executing these happenings wherein concepts and fascinations are loaned a body for a weekend (not just the hotel, but the participants–the Corpus Vapori, if you like). Steampunk is how I discovered "my thing".

### How do you personally embody Steampunk?

Couchman – I'm woven into the infrastructure providing a public forum, a market square and a showcase for new twists in the movement. My job is to communicate steampunk to the public and to host what for many fans (and creators) is their annual peak experience ...
 and then there's the film festival, which is its own strange & demanding animal. I spend most of my time and all of my disposable income doing these jobs. As such, I don't feel I have anything to prove where "embodying" steampunk is concerned; for example, unlike most people in my position, I don't dress the part–I own four items of steampunk regalia, and not only do they not comprise a full outfit, I don't believe I've ever worn two of them at the same time. I certainly embody steampunk as an engaged, vocal reader and book-buyer, which I consider both a pleasure and a professional courtesy.

### What values does Steampunk promote?

Couchman – Socially, steampunk enthusiasts do tend toward genteel manners and grandiosity in fine pseudo-Victorian fashion; I don't, however, believe our collective roleplaying persona is where we can best be said to exhibit the movement's values. Steampunk promotes the re-examination of the origins of our modern world, rewards the free exchange of knowledge & skills (especially of the "forgotten" variety), and uses the ornate-mechanical aesthetic to promote a harmony between beauty and utility. In truth, steampunk is so broad a phenomenon, expressed by so diverse a global population across so many outlets, that there is no short answer to this question–but there is a book! <a href="http://vintagetomorrows.com/" target="_blank">Vintage Tomorrows</a> is a collaborative examination/criticism of steampunk by a futurist and a cultural historian, available at fine bookstores everywhere.
